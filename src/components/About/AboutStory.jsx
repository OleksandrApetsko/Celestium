        Celestium began with a question — how would astrology look if rebuilt today,
        from data, clarity and design rather than myth and mysticism? We envisioned
        something intuitive, cinematic, emotionally intelligent.

        Every insight here is crafted with care — planetary motion interpreted as
        human experience, compatibility explored with nuance, and user experience
        shaped like a constellation: structured, elegant, alive.
        Celestium grows with every release, just as people do.
