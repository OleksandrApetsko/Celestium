      <p>
        The Moon governs tides — both oceanic and emotional. Each lunar phase
        affects your mood, focus and inner rhythm in a subtle but measurable way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>New Moon</strong> is ideal for setting intentions and starting fresh.
        <strong>First Quarter</strong> brings action, courage and small challenges that help you grow.
        <strong>Full Moon</strong> illuminates truth, heightens emotions and reveals what is ready to be seen.
        <strong>Waning phases</strong> support release, decluttering and emotional reset.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you align your routines with lunar cycles, your productivity and emotional
        stability increase not through force, but through resonance with cosmic timing.

      <p>
        Compatibility is not about “good” or “bad” signs. It is the interaction of elements,
        modalities and planetary rulers between two charts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fire signs</strong> (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) seek passion and movement.  
        <strong>Earth signs</strong> (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) need stability and reliability.  
        <strong>Air signs</strong> (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) crave mental stimulation and ideas.  
        <strong>Water signs</strong> (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) require emotional depth and safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harmonious relationships often appear where elements complement or balance each other,
        while challenging ones tend to push both partners toward growth and self-awareness.

      <p>
        Retrograde is an optical illusion where a planet appears to move backward in the sky.
        Symbolically, this signals a time to review, reconsider and realign.
      </p>
      <p>
        During <strong>Mercury retrograde</strong>, communication, contracts and technology often require extra attention.
        For <strong>Venus retrograde</strong>, themes of values, relationships and self-worth come to the surface.
        <strong>Mars retrograde</strong> affects motivation, conflict and the way we assert ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of fear, use retrogrades as a tool: back up your data, think twice before making big decisions,
        and observe which patterns life is asking you to finally revise.

        Your birth chart is a symbolic map of the sky at the exact moment and place of your birth.
        It describes your potential, patterns and main lessons in this lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sun</strong> shows your core identity and life force.  
        <strong>Moon</strong> reveals emotional needs and instinctive reactions.  
        <strong>Rising sign</strong> (Ascendant) describes your behavior and the way others first perceive you.  
        <strong>Houses</strong> reflect life areas such as career, home, relationships and spirituality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you understand these fundamentals, astrology becomes a practical tool for self-awareness
        instead of something abstract or purely mystical.

        The four elements in astrology describe how your energy moves and interacts with the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fire</strong> (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) acts, initiates and inspires.  
        <strong>Earth</strong> (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) stabilizes, structures and manifests.  
        <strong>Air</strong> (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) connects, communicates and analyzes.  
        <strong>Water</strong> (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) feels, intuits and heals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your chart is always a mix of all four. Understanding your dominant element explains your natural pace,
        your needs and your way of relating to both people and reality.

        Manifestation becomes more effective when you align your actions with cosmic timing instead of
        pushing against it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>New Moon</strong> — set clear and specific intentions.  
        <strong>Waxing phases</strong> — take action, build momentum and move projects forward.  
        <strong>Full Moon</strong> — harvest results, celebrate wins and observe what is no longer aligned.  
        <strong>Waning phases</strong> — release what blocks you, declutter and reset your energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combined with planetary transits to your personal chart, this approach turns astrology into
        a practical roadmap for long-term goals and everyday steps.
