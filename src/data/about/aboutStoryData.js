    "Celestium started as an attempt to rethink how astrology is presented in a digital space — with clarity, structure, and a focus on long-term perspective rather than isolated readings.",
    "Instead of relying on abstract symbolism or vague interpretations, the platform was designed to organize astrological information into clear sections, consistent patterns, and accessible formats.",
    "Compatibility, birth charts, and extended horoscopes are presented as interconnected parts of a broader system, helping users explore astrology with context rather than assumptions.",
    "Celestium continues to evolve as new sections and features are added, with an emphasis on coherence, usability, and a balanced view of astrological cycles over time."
